# Compel-O-Meter

## About

Compel-O-Meter is a tool to help individuals critically evaluate written content. Based on a user's inputted text, it outputs the text's compellingness (i.e., How persuasive is the text?), and direction of compellingness (Does it convince for or against a topic?). Armed with this knowledge, users can become better aware of their content's intent and guard themselves against manipulative texts.
